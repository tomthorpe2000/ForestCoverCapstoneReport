Springboard Data Science Foundation - Forest Cover Capstone Project Report

Thomas L Thorpe

The Forest Cover Capstone Project applies techniques learned in the
Springboard Data Science Foundation Course to predict the type of tree
coverage in four different wilderness areas in Colorado.
Determining the tree coverage type helps the US Forest Service
plan and implement forest management policies.

The data used comes from the Ph.D. dissertation by Jock Blackard, 1998,
"Comparison of Neural Networks and
Discriminant Analysis in Predicting Forest Cover Types.", 
Department of Forest Sciences,
Colorado State University,  Fort Collins, Colorado.
The data can be found here:
